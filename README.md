# Getting started
The C# SDK allowes you to accept Bitcoin payments from you C# .NET app using the SetGetGo REST API.
The SDK has been designed to act as a wrapper for all the main SetGetGo functionalities, 
allowing the developer to focus on the actual purchasing flow rather than on speific details of the the API interaction.

The SDK is also available as a NuGet download from this URL:  [tbd]
